# Tahoma (Mt. Rainier) - Ingraham Direct to Fuhrer Finger, May 5th 2025

### Intro

In February of 2018, I arrived in Washington for what would be my last IFSA Freeride competition at Crystal Mountain. After 5 years of driving  up and down I-70 twice a week for training with my club ski team all winter, I was largely burned out on skiing, and lacking motivation to compete well. I was slowly realizing that I was better suited for endurance sport, and my mediocre comp skiing only confirmed that notion. Though I was ready to move on from freeride and prioritize my running, the trip planted a seed that would come to shape my life 6 years later. 

When the clouds briefly parted at Crystal, the view of Tahoma was astonishing. The mountain is simply so much larger than anything I had ever seen. I knew that people skied from the summit, but I didn’t understand the scale of such an undertaking until I saw the mountain for myself. Immediately upon seeing such an incomprehensibly large mountain in person, I felt like ski mountaineering, not freeride, was the pinnacle of the sport. I wondered if one day I’d be able to climb and ski these big, glaciated mountains.

For the next 4 years in college, I barely skied at all, but the thought of climbing and skiing Tahoma stuck in the back of my mind. Track and cross country running ultimately proved to be a little too abrasive for my body, so I found my way back to the mountains via trail running, and ski mountaineering once again returned to the forefront of my mind. When I applied for grad school in 2023, proximity to mountains was honestly my highest priority in selecting a school. Getting into the University of Washington was a dream come true for both my research and skiing aspirations. Ahead of moving to Seattle, I got back into skiing fully focused on touring and mountaineering. I swapped my old alpine race boots and heavy skis for light touring equipment, and took a ski mountaineering class that covered the basics of glacier travel, alpine climbing, and steep skiing. 

When I arrived in Seattle last summer, my goal of climbing and skiing Tahoma was cemented the moment I first caught a view of the mountain from the city. In my mind, skiing the Fuhrer Finger is the obvious objective for a skier. It’s decently technical (to me at least) with a lot of glacier travel, and boasts a very aesthetic 10,000 foot ski descent that includes a ~40 degree couloir. I assumed it was unlikely that I’d tick this objective off in my first season in the PNW, but I was lucky to meet some like-minded friends via skimo racing, and in early May we had green-light conditions and a strong team of 3 with Emett (who I recently had signed up to race the Kulshan Randonee with) and his wife Emily (a fellow runner who absolutely smoked me in some friday night skimo races). We knew the route was in good shape after a few parties skied the line from the summit in april, and with a week of cold temps opening up to a corn cycle, we were on!

### The climb

Arriving at paradise the evening before, I was really feeling the nerves and excitement. It felt crazy that after spending so much time thinking about this. I had been spending a lot of time practicing crevasse rescue, but this would be my first day of real glacier travel without a guide. Emett and Emily had a solid amount of glacier experience together, but this would be an unfamiliar climb for all of us. I felt confident in my skills but I was certainly experiencing some self doubt - on paper, this was a big step up in technicality and risk from any backcountry skiing I had ever done. Surprisingly, I managed to get some okay sleep on the new platform I had built for my subaru. 

With freezing levels dropping to 2000 feet that night, and the snow at Paradise already frozen solid at 8pm, we opted to sleep in by mountaineering standards, aiming to start at 5am. Knowing most parties do not summit in a single push, and those that do often start at 1am or earlier, this added to my self doubt. However, we thought summitting in 7 hours would be reasonable if things went smoothly, and even if we took 8, 9, or 10 hours, with the deep freeze and forecasted wind and temperatures we’d probably still catch corn in the Finger pretty late in the afternoon.

_Sunrise over the Tatoosh_

When we departed paradise at 5:15am, hikers headed to Muir were confused as to why us skiers were headed out so early. With our light skimo packs, none of them even considered the fact that we might be aiming to summit. We didn’t even need headlamps as we started up towards pan point, and we were treated to a beautiful sunrise over the Tatoosh and southern volcanoes. We kept the effort casual to reach Camp Muir in 3 hours. I was feeling antsy sipping on redbull from my soft flask, but held back knowing we were on schedule, and Emily’s stomach was bothering her.

_The usual slog to Muir_

At Muir, Emily said she was feeling the altitude, but that this was pretty normal for her and it would probably resolve. She told Emett and I that we could continue without her, but we wanted to share the experience as a group, and I also felt much more comfortable with a rope team of 3. We discussed turning around if Emily got worse, and transitioned to crampons and roped up with Emily in the middle, Emett on the front, and me in the rear. At this point, two skiers arrived at muir having turned around somewhere on the ID. They seemed a little out of it, and said it was “super windy”. They gave off kind of a weird vibe, and it left me feeling a little unsettled. We reiterated to each other that it’d be okay to turn around, and we set off from Muir at a slower pace than we’d envisioned to allow for Emily to recover. 

I’d been to Muir 4 times prior at this point, but those first steps onto the Glacier were uncharted territory for me, and the magnitude of what we were doing began to set in. Everything on this mountain is huge — it’s nearly incomprehensible for a mind accustomed to Colorado’s comparatively smaller, non-glaciated mountains. I’d studied the route quite a bit and thought I had an idea about how each section would feel, but I was surprised by how long it felt to walk from Muir to the Ingraham flats. Such a short distance on the map felt like quite the traverse in real life. Similarly, the Seracs on the Ingraham were much larger than they’d looked in photos. As the turned around climbers warned, it was indeed windy, which also upped the feeling of exposure. We were in big kid terrain, and it was time to focus.

_We're moutaineering now!_

Fortunately, Emily’s stomach was turning around, and we were able to make efficient work of the lower portion of the Ingraham exposed to the seracs. We were lucky to be able to follow an excellent route set by the guide companies — they’d even left pickets for a running belay through the steep sections. This allowed us to pick up momentum, and soon we’d made it through the exposed section and paused just above Gibaltar rock where we regrouped and had a snack. We’d encountered another two skiers who had turned around due to wind, but personally I was gaining confidence in our group and found this less unsettling that the first party. We had a bootpack and wands to follow, and the summit felt within reach. It was time to put our heads down and grind it out.  

Then came the wind. I thought it was windy down on the lower Ingraham, but I had no idea just how windy it would be on the upper mountain. It was the kind of wind that picks up the skis on your pack and nearly hoists you into the air. Our progress slowed, and on top of that, the lenticular we’d hoped would clear off was actually getting larger. Yelling over the wind, we decided we’d keep going, trusting the route set by the guides. Things got progressively more intense weather-wise, and soon we were in a full whiteout with subzero windchill. I felt fine physically, but we just could not move fast in those conditions, and it took a long time to reach the summit crater. I’d been telling myself that the crater would shelter us from the wind, but that could not have been further from reality. If anything the crater amplified the wind.

Emett and Emily checked the GPS to find the new true summit and when we arrived we had to literally lay down to avoid being blown away. I did my best to coil the rope in the wind and transition quickly while not freezing — there was no time to enjoy the summit. We clicked into our skis and checked the GPS to point ourselves in the direction of the upper Nisqually. As we skied off the summit, there were no more wands or tracks to follow, and it felt questionable to descend onto a glacier in a whiteout, but we had GPX tracks to follow and knew there was sunny weather somewhere below us. 

### The descent

Fortunately, we were out of the lenticular within minutes. The view from the upper nisqually is insane, with a massive glacier cascading below, and the entire mountain beneath you. It dawned on me what a crazy position I was in — I find the Nisqually very intimidating when viewed from Paradise, and I realized that I was now skiing above that massive icefall. Once again the magnitude of this endeavor set in, and I knew I needed to keep my focus while we crossed the glacier. The incredibly firm, wind hammered snow added to the intensity, requiring precise turns and good technique even on the relatively low angle terrain.

_What an insane vantage point, from the top of the upper nisqually._

In my opinion, the upper Nisqually is by far the biggest crux of this route. I think climbing the Finger from the bottom and skipping the upper mountain would be a very casual outing in comparison to skiing off the summit. I am surprised this is not emphasized more in guidebooks and trip reports — probably due to climate change the upper glacier is more melted out. To the best of my knowledge, no parties successfully climbed the upper Nisqually this year (please correct me if I am wrong), all appear to have turned around due to relatively large open crevasses. Many parties were able to ski down though, so it seems like climbing this route bottom up is no longer viable, at least without a considerable amount of faffing around setting up belays to get over open crevasses.

_Here's me trying to find away around the first open crevasse._

Our GPX tracks pointed us straight down the center of the glacier, with massive seracs on either side, and the slope steepening towards open crevasses beneath us. It felt insane to continue skiing the fall line towards an obviously open, very large crevasse, but I knew from both previous parties and my own visual inspection of the line that this was the best option. We had discussed possibly needing to rope up skiing down the upper nisqually, but the snow was extremely firm and buffed out by wind, so this would not have been a good idea. The glacier itself is not that steep, but in these conditions and with this exposure, I found the skiing engaging to say the least. I did my best to channel the good technique instilled in me by my former ski coaches, and made my way down towards the first crevasse, looking for a bridge or safe place to hop over it.

_I'm smiling but I'm actually stressed TF out._

After traversing around a bit above the first crevasse, I was surprised to find a really solid bridge which we easily traversed. Viewed from paradise, there were two large cracks on the upper nisqually, and other parties had reported “hopping” over at least one, so I assumed the next crack would be the crux. We continued to cautiously make our way down the glacier, and the path towards the Finger was starting to become more obvious. Soon the second open crack was in view, and was indeed intimidating. This one was kind of shelf like, with a considerable drop from one side down to a flatter slope below. There was also a strange vertical crack in a buldge in the middle, which added some complexity.

I ended up sweeping from the right side of the vertical crack, traversing accross it at it’s narrowest point. This minimized the drop and provided a slightly steeper landing and a transition to the flatter slope below. That move was really counter intuitive until you were basically committed to skiing over the crack, so I did my best to articulate it over the radio to Emily and Emett. Both of them made it over with minimal trouble. Now we were over the two main cracks, with an obvious traverse over to the entrance of the finger now in view. We made quick work of the traverse and it was incredibly relieving to make it off of the glacier — this felt like the summit to me. The hard work of the day was done, so we finally took a substantial break and ate some food. At this elevation the snow had finally softened, and it looked like we’d have an excellent ski down the Finger in good corn, despite some tracks from parties who had climbed it bottom up and only skied the Finger.

_Finally into the finger!_

The upper section of the Finger had some some funky half-soft, half-frozen snow that was substantially chopped up by previous skiers, but as soon as we got into the more sheltered couloir, the snow was perfectly soft, smooth, and absolutley rippable. We traded leads skiing sections of 400 feet or so, being mindful to stop with minimal overhead hazard. Our legs were smoked from the climb but it was really fun skiing. I think the Finger is the perfect angle to just be really fun, without being overly stressful like a steep couloir can be. We joked about having already forgotten the cold summit and stressful glacier descent, this is the part of the day that would stick in our memory. The finger is definitely worthy of its “classic” designation.

_Emett and Emily ripping perfect corn at the bottom of the finger._

Skiing out onto the apron, we opted for the skier’s left exit onto the lower glaciers. We found perfect, untouched corn on this side. Given that it was already after 3pm, I was expecting the snow to turn to mush, but as we proceeded down the lower glaciers, the corn harvest only continued. The previous night’s deep freeze and daytime wind had perfectly delayed the corn cycle and kept conditions good until remarkably low on the mountain. The turns on the lower glaciers were among the best I had all season, with super fun rolling terrain and pristine snow. Soon we had cruised all the way down to the base of the Nisqually Chute, back in familiar territory, and we continued down the long, flat exit towards paradise.

_More perfect corn!!_

As we stopped to transition for the final skin back up towards the car, it was a really special feeling to look back towards the gigantic mountain, our full descent route in view, knowing we what we had just climbed and skied. The lenticular that had made the upper mountain so intense looked small and insignificant from down here, and massive seracs appeared as just a bit of texture on the glacier. I was surprised to feel a little bit emotional. I felt a sense of accomplishment that I rarely feel. In running, I’ve always set ambitious goals and I’ve never been totally satisfied with any performance. This was different though, this objective had been on my mind for years, and I’d actually just completed it. It felt incredibly gratifying to see through such a long term vision, and do something that my younger self would think is so badass.

After a brief skin, we were back the crowds of national park visitors around paradise.  It’s always funny returning to civilization after a long outing like this — skiing into paradise after summiting reminded me a lot of returning to the south rim of the Grand Canyon after running rim to rim to rim. It’s strange to have such an intense day, one that changes how you think of yourself and the world, only to return imediately back to totally normal life. I kind of like that aspect of these types of outings compared to running a race, for example. There are no high fives from anyone except the friends you shared the experience with, and only a few confused glances from strangers. Without a contrived finish line experience, the experience takes on a significant personal meaning to me. I love the comaraderie and competition of a race, but creating your own experience in the mountains to share with only a few friends is a unique and special experience.

_Done!_

We had some snacks and bubbly water back at the parking lot, and by 5pm I was heading back to Seattle. It was a Monday, and I’d snuck away from the lab and skipped my afternoon class, so I couldn’t soak things in for too long. Driving home I felt an interesting mix of emotions — a part of me didn't want to set foot on a glacier again for a long time, but at the same time, I couldn't help from glancing at the mountain over my shoulder as I drove, dreaming about the other ski lines. The Kautz, Edmunds Headwall, and Mowhich Face, each looming prominently above my drive home, had all felt out of reach, but now having been to the summit I couldn't help but wonder what else I could ski up there.

### Intro

Trail running is obviously an excellent means of discovering new places. But one of my favorite things about running is developing a deep relationship with the trails close to home–observing how a mountain changes through the seasons, experiencing its many moods, and learning the intricacies of its terrain. Eventually, running feels like floating on autopilot, I don’t even have to think about where I am going, I can simply let the trails unfold in front of me. Over the last year, Mt Si has become that place for me. I’ve amassed many, many miles and tens of thousands of feet of vert there. I’ve been on it in every season, in all conditions, at every time of day. I can tell my Old Si split nearly to the second without even looking at my watch. All year long I’ve been looking forward to racing on Mt. Si again. 

Upon moving to Seattle at the end of the summer in 2024, Mt. Si almost immediately became a staple run for me. About 3 weeks after I arrived in Seattle, I raced the Mt Si Hillclimb. I wasn’t in the greatest shape, and definitely didn’t have my climbing legs, but something clicked and I had the best descent of my life chasing Andrew Bachman down the new Si trail. He gunned me down on the flat path back to town, but it was one of the best battles and most fun races I’ve ever had. I knew after that Mt. Si would be a frequent training ground for me–I loved the super steep but smooth and runnable trails, the rock gardens, the old growth forests, and the summit views. It’s just a special place. I raced the North Bend Trail Fest a month later (got absolutely worked by Max King and co), and for the year since Mt Si has been a frequent spot for both big vert long runs and shorter, high intensity days. 

**A brief aside regarding the under-appreciated running on Mt. Si:**

Many people told me when I moved here that Mt. Si is overcrowded and/or overrated, but I‘ve found the exact opposite to be true, relatively speaking. Considering its proximity to a major city (without traffic, it’s 35 minutes from my apartment near Seattle Center), I think Mt Si is world class running, and severely under rated. Sure, parking fills up at the little Si trailhead, but there’s a simple solution: don’t park there. Parking downtown or at Torguson park allows for a very pleasant ~mile jog to warm up before climbing anyway. And compared to many trailheads close to major American cities, the trails at Mt. Si are never really that crowded, they’re plenty wide for passing, and it’s super easy to find yourself alone out there by doing your run at an off time of day or choosing one of the less popular trails. And honestly as a training location for european style mountain running races, there aren’t many other places in the country that can even compare. How many other easily accessible VKs are there in North America? Let alone single trail systems with 4 VKs?? And they’re all awesome, with varying runnability and technicality. For those of you into ~technical~ terrain you can get your fix on the Haystack. When you just need to sneak out and get some vert, you can even do a 15 mile loop with 8 thousand feet of climbing without repeating any trail. That’s sick. I am astonished by how few people run at Mt. Si–just compare the segments here to segments on Green Mountain in Boulder. C’mon Seattlites! Get out there! It’s some of the best trail running in the world and we can hit it after work!

**Okay back to the race report:**

I’ve made huge leaps as a trail runner in the last year. Unfortunately, I sort of put all of my eggs into one basket running the Speedgoat 50k this year, which didn’t really pay off for me (Maybe I’ll finish my race report for Speedgoat at some point, TL:DR I went out hard then threw up and suffered in 18th place). After Speedgoat, I had a bit of a void in my late summer racing schedule. On a whim I signed up for the Dark Divide 50k, a lowkey local race, but I unfortunately (and stupidly) ran off the course very early on and DNF’d. This stung–I really wanted to make the most of the fitness I’d gained in the last year, but couldn’t put everything together in my only two races of the summer. At least I still had the North Bend Trail Fest in October to shift my focus towards. 

Last year, I thought I had a long shot chance of winning this race–a pipe dream that was quickly trounced by Max King (GOAT) and Talon Hull (local legend, Brooks pro) who were surprise late entries. They took things out hot battling for the $1000 prize. I was not fit enough to contend off such a hot pace and wound up a distant 6th. I knew that I would be coming back in 2025, and even though I was primarily focused on Speedgoat for the year, this race remained on the back of my mind all summer. In the weeks leading up to the race, I periodically checked ultrasignup wondering if Max or any other heavy hitters would register seeking the generous prize for first. Remarkably, no big names appeared on the entry list–I would have liked an opportunity to race some guys like that again, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little bit relieved. Winning felt well within my capabilities, I just needed to execute on the day. 

Race weekend brought the first storm and cold temps of the fall. The snow line was forecasted to hover around 4k’, which is summit elevation, with the heaviest precipitation of the weekend falling during race time. This meant the traverse to Teneriffe would likely be snow covered, and all of the running down low would be cold and wet. While this added another element of unpredictability to the race, I felt like it probably played to my strengths a bit. Going all the way back to high school cross country, I’ve always raced a little better relative to others in poor conditions, and, as I mentioned earlier, I’ve run many miles on Si and Teneriffe in the rain and snow over the last year. The conditions didn’t change how I approached the race, but I did gain a bit of confidence feeling like I was probably more prepared for and less afraid of the weather (who knows if that was actually true).

My race plan hinged a lot on who showed up. If I had to race any heavy hitters like Max King, it was simple, just follow and hang on. But I also knew I needed to have the confidence to take control and win the race, whether that would be a late move, or letting a gap build early and running a lot of the race solo. I really liked the updates to the course this year–no more out and back on little Si, and a slightly longer looping way back from Teneriffe–but I knew they could really could really change the dynamic of the race with a new technical section coming down the Teneriffe Falls trail and steep little 800 foot climb at mile ~14. Whatever happened during the race, I knew I needed to be focused and ready to push hard late in the race, at the exact point I was falling apart last year. 

### The race

![The Start](assets/post_media/2025-North_Bend_Trail_Fest_30k/01_start.jpg)_The start_

The sun had risen for the start, but the rain clouds kept it surprisingly dark, and a low cloud sat ominously over Mt. Si, obscuring the summit. I quickly found myself at the front of the pack on the gravel path, which surprised me. James Stadler, who I met at Dark Divide bridged up to me, and we took things out in a reasonable but uptempo 5:47 for the first mile. As we got onto the trail, Justin Daniels, who I shared miles with on Mt. Si last year caught me, and in the first rock garden he took the lead from me and really picked up the pace. This caught me off guard, I thought I was setting an aggressive pace for the climb, but I was excited to have someone keen to get after it so I chased after him. He kept ratcheting up the pace, eventually to beyond what I felt was sustainable. As he started to drop me I noticed his shoe was untied–sure enough, he had just been trying to get some breathing room so he could stop and tie his shoe. I passed him back as he was stopped, and he quickly jumped on my tail. This time though, he seemed content to let me lead, which I was happy to do.  

I knew several of the fast guys who ended up turning out for the race. I felt like I was probably the strongest on steep climbs, but Justin is an aerobic monster (both on foot and on the bike), and has been crushing all summer, and James and Michael Schneider are both fast track guys–I was nervous about going out too hard, especially with my plan to push hard late in the race, but I decided it was probably best to take any time I could get on this first climb. I locked into an effort slightly less intense than threshold, and found a rhythm. Soon, the elastic between Justin and I snapped, and I started building a gap. I resisted the urge to push extra hard, refrained from looking over my shoulder, and just ran my own pace, letting the gap build slowly. Experience on the course was already benefitting me, I think I paced the first climb perfectly because I could settle into a familiar rhythm knowing exactly what was ahead. 

![Topping out on Old Si](assets/post_media/2025-North_Bend_Trail_Fest_30k/02_Si.jpg)_Topping out on Old Si_

I split 44:00 on the Old Si segment, 1:15 off my PR from a workout in August but 1:28 faster than when I raced the hillclimb last year. I was slightly worried about the cold–the summit was socked in with fog, and I got completely soaked by all of the wet bushes along the trail–but I felt great and knew I had things under control. Coming off the climb, I took the brief descent over to the Teneriffe trail aggressively, which my legs handled well. Beginning the traverse over Teneriffe I committed to keeping things aggressive. I told myself that  if I could build a gap to the top of Teneriffe, I probably had the race in the bag.

On the traverse, I pressed hard on the climbs and floated the flat sections. I could tell I was having a good day. Whenever I pushed, my legs responded instantly, and I wasn’t fatiguing. As I ascended, the air got colder and colder and the rain slowly transitioned to snow. Once on the ridge heading toward Tenerriffe, there was enough snow on the ground to pleasantly insulate sound, and it was eerily quiet. I arrived at the summit alone, with a healthy gap. No volunteers braved the cold summit this year. Alone with my thoughts as I turned around and began the descent, I felt whispers of doubt–they could catch me, you might not be that far ahead–but I also had an acute awareness that I was experiencing something special. I had visualized this race for a year, and here I was, leading and in control of the race at the turnaround, feeling exceptionally good. I committed to enjoying the descent, and soaking in such a special day. 

After the turnaround, I continued pushing on the upper part of the descent, but I don’t think any meaningful amounts of time could have been gained or lost descending this section in the snow that day. The snow and wet mud necessitated control and limited my descending pace. It was exciting to pass by all of my competitors and exchange words of encouragement. Once I got off the ridge and muddy switchbacks, I was back into the rain but also onto firmer ground. I was feeling amazing, and let my stride naturally open up once I had better footing. I wanted to take advantage of the long, straight and relatively smooth section before the switchbacks, so I let gravity do the work and my mind go blank. I’d need to focus once I hit the technical section below Teneriffe falls. 

Well, I may have let my mind go a little too blank–I clipped a rock with my toe and got launched into a superman dive. Fortunately I managed to get my right foot back under me and didn’t land too hard, but my left knee took a hit. I managed to spring back up and get right back into my stride, but it was a reminder that I did not in fact have the race in the bag. This was trail running afterall, and I’d need to stay on my feet to take the win. With renewed focus, I continued pushing onto the switchbacks. 

![The Descent](assets/post_media/2025-North_Bend_Trail_Fest_30k/03_Descent.jpg)_Descending  fast, bit of blood was spilled_

Next, I proceeded onto the new portion of the course, the cut over to Teneriffe falls trail. The switchbacks below the falls are not steep, but it’s entirely scree, which was extra difficult in the rain. I had flagged this section in my head, and I was mentally prepared to stay focused and keep things moving here. I don’t think this is a section where you can gain a lot of time, but it’s definitely a section where you could lose a lot of time if you rolled an ankle and lost momentum or something. I kept it together and made it through this section pretty well. Following the techy section there’s a long and pretty flat loop around, which I kept things aggressive on but also took the opportunity to mentally regroup before the last climbing section. 

New to the course this year was an 800 foot climb up the lower part of Teneriffe trail and onto the talus loop trail. Knowing how destroyed I was late in the race last year, I anticipated this being a place where the race could be won or lost. With good legs, you could put a solid gap on people here. With bad legs, you could move backwards. I thought I had a healthy lead, but I was still feeling great and wanted to use this climb as an opportunity to really solidify the win. I really attacked this section, and it felt hard, but I was pleased to see strava segments validate that I actually ran it fast and it didn’t just feel fast because I was gassed. Getting back over to the Mt. Si trail, I knew the race was all but sealed–as long as I didn’t fall. 

I kept the pace respectable for the final portion of the descent down the boulder garden and onto the little Si trail, but definitely slowed things down and took less risk. The last thing I needed was to roast my ankle with 2 miles to go. At this point I could really appreciate what a special run I’d had. Last year, I was essentially crawling it at the end of the race on totally blown out legs. I simply didn’t have the strength and fitness to handle running that fast for that long. This year, I was running much faster and I felt totally in control for the entire distance. I know how rare it is for things to line up like that in running so when I got onto the final flat mile back to town I really tried to soak in the feeling. 

![The Finish](assets/post_media/2025-North_Bend_Trail_Fest_30k/04_Finish.jpg)_Celebrating at the finish with Scott_

At the finish Scott Sowle, the race director, greeted me with a high five, hug, and very kind words on the megaphone. It was nice chatting with Scott, he puts such a tremendous amount of work into this race and his vert running series, which is such an amazing service to the PNW running community. I really hope to see this race and series continue to grow! Soon my competitors (/friends) began rolling in. After sitting for a bit after the finish, I was headed towards hypothermia. I attempted to warm up with some hot apple cider they had at the finish, then had to sit in my car with the heat on. Eventually I warmed up enough to go hang out with people and attend the awards.  It was awesome sharing the podium with Micheal, who I’d run some miles with this summer, and Justin, who I met racing in North Bend last year.

Overall, this was one of the best races I’ve ever had, and a great experience shared with a lot of friends and the broader Washington running community. I am super stoked for more racing and to try and defend my title next year!

### Intro: Goals and approach to the season

### Speedgoat 50k 2025 - Another swing 

Speedgoat is the *hardest* 50k race North America, and the second hardest in the world (behind OCC, of course). Yeah sure, some random 50k on ultrasignup or some absurd euro race where you need to wear a helmet probably has more vert, is more technical, whatever, but speedgoat and OCC are the *hardest* 50ks in the world. No other race in North America has the combination of vert, technicality, runnability (yes, that can make things harder), and **competition** that speedgoat has (same goes for OCC on the global scale). 

It's easy to get caught up in the stats of speedgoat—50k with 11k vert—and overlook the other aspects of what makes it hard. On both the men's and women's side, this is arguably the only short ultra in North America that has consistently drawn a deep professional field for more than a decade. It's as competitive as any American race not called Western States, which is particularly unique considering how mountainous the course is. In addition to raw vert, the course has a unique combination of technicality and runnability; you're gonna spend a lot of time on steep, nasty, loose and rocky surfaces, BUT it's weirdly possible to *run* fast on almost the entire course. This means that to win the race, you have to risk both catastropic blowup (it's gonna go out FAST), and catastrophic ankle injury. Oh yeah, and you spend much of the race 10k feet above sea level, which amplifies the consequences of any mistake. 

In 2022, new to trail racing but with the sting of my disappointing collegiate running career still fresh, I had the delusional idea that I could be competitive at Speedgoat. Predicatably, I suffered the most catastrophic blowup I'd ever experienced running, going out near the front before vomitting then limping my way to the finish. I was stunned by how absurdly hard the course was, it was truly humbling. It took me at least a year before I could even fathom doing the race again, and I was really intimidated to sign up again this year after moving back to the mountains. I kn

It's easy to get caught up in the stats of speedgoat—50k with 11k vert—and overlook the other aspects of what makes it such a hard race. On both the men's and women's side, this is arguably the only short ultra in North America that has consistently drawn a deep professional field for more than a decade. It's among the most competitive ultras in America, which is particularly unique considering how mountainous the course is. In addition to raw vert, the course has a unique combination of technicality and runnability; you're gonna spend a lot of time on steep, nasty, loose and rocky surfaces, BUT it's weirdly possible to *run* fast on almost the entire course. This means that to win the race, you have to risk both catastropic blowup (it's gonna go out FAST), and catastrophic ankle injury. Oh yeah, and the race is entirely bewteen 8k and 11k feet above sea level, which amplifies the consequences of any mistake.

In 2022, new to trail racing but with the sting of my disappointing collegiate running career still fresh, I had the delusional idea that I could be competitive at Speedgoat. Predicatably, I suffered the most catastrophic blowup I'd ever experienced running, going out near the front before vomitting then limping my way to the finish. I was stunned by how absurdly hard the course was. I had never been caught so off guard by a race—even though I was pretty fit and handled climbing pretty well, my body just could not handle the course, at all. It was truly humbling.

From 2022 to 2024 I lived outside of Washington DC, so trail running took a backseat. Speedgoat stayed on my mind though. I knew I'd need to really step things up when I got back to trail racing. Mostly, I'd need to get way better at descending, and build up the strength and muscular endurance to handle that volume of climbing and descending. Even though I lived in the flatlands, I adjusted my strength training to be much better suited for mountain running, and sought out any way that I could work on the *skill* of trail running. It turns out rock creek park actually has a bunch of 

Coming into the summer, I struggled to settle on races to prioritize. I knew I wanted to focus on 50k and shorter, and none of the local options felt particularly inspiring.  

Starting the race I set some tiered goals- 

A. Top 3 (Felt attainable if I had a perfect day), 
B. Top 10
C. Finish without throwing up

Hello! And welcome to my soapbox.

I made this website becuase I yearned for a place that I could deposit my long-form pontifications, free from the constraints of any “algorithm”. For me, these ramblings are a way to collect my thoughts, or to commemorate a moment in time with more than just a photo and caption in the endless feed, or to argue a point to no particular audience for no particular reason. For whoever may stumble upon this page, I hope to share tidbits of information that might help someone else gain access to the opportunities and experiences I’ve been fortunate enough to have, or avoid the mistakes I’ve made along the way.

My interests lie primarily within the realms of mountain endurance sports, and science. These two realms feel connected to me, but I understand it might seem strange to see them both on the same webpage—forgive me, and if you’re interested in only one of those realms, or a particular niche within either of them, you can filter content on the site using the `categories` and `tags`. 

Professionally, I am an aspiring scientist, and I’m currently in the [Molecular and Cellular Biology PhD program](https://mcb-seattle.edu/) at the University of Washington. I am split between the [Srivatsan Lab](https://www.srivatsan-lab.com/) at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center, and the [Harris Lab](https://www.harris-lab.com/) in UW Genome Sciences. Most broadly, my research aims to understand how the genome encodes the information required to build such complex organisms as human beings. Prior to UW, I did undergrad at Northern Arizona University, where I worked in Dr. Naomi Lee's vaccine lab, then I was an NIH postbac for two years, working in Dr. Prashant Chittiboina's lab in the Surgical Neurology Branch of NINDS.

Outside of work, I am a runner and skier. Growing up in Colorado, I competed in IFSA freeride events and dreamt of being a professional skier. Soon enough though it became clear that I was better suited for endurance sport, and I dove fully into XC/track/road running. These days, I’m trying to blend these backgrounds by focusing on mountain running in the summer and ski mountaineering in the winter. I coach myself and view training as my little n=1 science experiment, and good science requires sharing methods and results, both positive and negative.

I also despise the culture of gatekeeping that pervades mountain sports. I believe that expanding access, sharing information, and fostering open communication will make the experience of outdoor recreation more enjoyable and safer for everyone. I hope this website can become my small contribution towards that goal.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to reach out to me via the links in the bottom left.
